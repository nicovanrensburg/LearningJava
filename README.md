# LearningJava

### Great resources for learning Java Laguage:

### Great Resources for Spring

Spring is a very commonly used Enterprise Library.  
[Spring Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/spring/)

### Build tools. 

Since we're using components and libraries build by other people to construct our applications we need a build management tool to make sure everything fits together and that will actually build our application into a war (web application archive) file. I recommend learning 
Maven, since it's the most commonly used [tutorial here] (http://tutorials.jenkov.com/maven/maven-tutorial.html)

### Source Control.
If you've ever lost your work on a word document you know how frustrating it can be to have to re-do it. When you lose hundreds of hours of code it can be devastating. To stop that, and to share our code with others on the team we use a Source control system. I recommend using Git, it's most widely used in the enterprise environment and if you know Git everything else is easy. [Tutorial here] (https://try.github.io/)

### UI Libraries
[Spring MVC](https://spring.io/guides) This is a very common library.

[Angular](https://angular.io/)
  
[JSF](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/documentation/index-137726.html) >real old but still widely used.


### Great IDE's 
It is essential to know your way around an IDE. The most commonly used IDE in enterprise environments is Eclipse which can be downloaded here: [Eclipse Oxygen](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
